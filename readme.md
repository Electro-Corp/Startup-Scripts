# Startup Scripts
A collection of scripts I've written in Python(i know i know calm down) to run <br>
on startup on remote terminal machines. Just basic stuff.

* `size.py` - prints out largest folder in home directory
* `git.py` - checks through all folders in home directory and tells you which repos can be updated
